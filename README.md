# Cross-level analysis addon for Capella (MBSE)

## Purpose
Level-led architecture (operational, system, logicial , physical, Product Breakdown Structure, etc) modelling is a way to design complex system by separation of concerns.

However this (usual and classic) way of proceeding does not ease to acquire a global level-independant view of the system and the top-down or bottom-up dependencies on a single diagramme.

## How it works
This add-on allows to generate a diagramme with tracing up and down all related objects (with the same object type) to the currently selected object, whatever the starting level.

## Visuals
TODO

## Installation
Download the build and unzip it in the dropins directory within your Capella installation. Restart Capella.
Then activate the corresponding viewpoint in Capella to enable it.

> Please consult the releases page for the supported Capella's version.

## Usage
Select an object, right click and select "Cross Analysis" --> Init Cross Layers Diagramme (CLD)
